‚úàÔ∏è Airline Passenger Satisfaction Prediction






üìå Project Overview

Airlines collect customer feedback to improve their services and enhance passenger satisfaction. This project uses machine learning classification models to predict whether a passenger is satisfied or dissatisfied based on their flight experience.

The goal is to:

    Understand key factors influencing satisfaction.
    
    Train ML models to predict satisfaction.
    
    Evaluate model performance using standard metrics.

üìä Dataset

Features include:

    Passenger demographics (Age, Gender, Customer Type)
    
    Flight details (Flight Distance, Departure/Arrival delays)
    
    Service ratings (Seat comfort, In-flight service, Cleanliness, etc.)
    
    Target variable: Satisfaction (Satisfied / Neutral or Dissatisfied)
